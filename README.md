**This project aims to simulate an automated parking space management system.**

In order to implement the above, we integrate sensors that 
* tracks (identifies) the incoming vehicles 
* checks capacity of the parking lot

Based on the outputs of these, we can convey to approaching vehicles the availability of spaces through a display. Furthermore, we can limit entry to only registered vehicles.
